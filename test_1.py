We will have a program determine which of the two salary options is more profitable within a span of 
10 days (we will also throw in a thrid option that would be set in case both options give the same 
result). Option 1 gives you $100 dollars a day. Option 2 starts you off with $1 the first day and 
doubles that amount every day after. There will be two functions to cacluate the pay rate. function1 
will calculate the amount for the first option, function2 will calculate the amount for the second 
option. 

function1 will output $100 * 10 days
function2 will loop 10 times, with each time, doubling the amount and add the amount to the total 
revenue.

if the amount is equal, we will output to the user "Option 1 and Option 2 pays the same"
if option1 is better, we output to the user "Option 1 is better"
if option2 is better, we output to the user "Option 2 is better"
